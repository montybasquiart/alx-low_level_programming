# Tasks
0. strcat - [0-strcat.c](./0-strcat.c) - A function that concatenates two strings.

    * Prototype: char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);
    * This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte
    * Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest
* FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strcat. Run man strcat to learn more.
